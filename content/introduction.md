# Origin

Sometime in 2015 or 2016 I stumbled on an old, worn copy of Hamlet and Macbeth.
It was annotated. Since I hadn't read Macbeth and it had been a while since I
read Hamlet, on a lark, I decided to read it.

In the final act of Hamlet, when the Prince arrives back at Elsinore from his
extended, disastrous, and fatal for Rosencrantz and Gildenstern, trip to
England, he's challenged to a duel with Laertes. Horatio says

> If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will forestall their repair hither,
> and say you are not fit.

To which Hamlet replies

> Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special providence in the fall of a
> sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now;
> if it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all: since no man has
> aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?

In the edition I was reading there was an annotation on the phrase "there's a
special providence in the fall of a sparrow." which read, if I recall
correctly, "cf. Matthew 10:29."

Me being me, of course I cracked open a Bible and found the passage:

> Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on
> the ground without your Father.

I was stunned. I can't even say why, it's just that something about the elegance
of the line, the sentiment expressed, and the intertextual play stunned me. It
was such a subtle reference I wondered how often that sort of thing appears in
text.

For a while I read Shakespeare, then I read a thick, annotated copy of the King
James Bible and The Literary Guide to the Bible. Before I knew it every time I
read a classic work I would by an Oxford World's Classics edition hoping for
more illuminating insight into the intertextual play in literature. I spotted it
all over, but one problem nagged me.

Each annotated copy of every book is different. They annotate different things,
have different focuses, and often focus on arcane textual issues, like that this
manuscript says x, the other says y. I began to wish for a good annotation
resource, especially one that focuses on the intertextual play between books.

And so was born the idea for anno.wiki.

Initially the idea was to focus on intertextual references, but halfway through
development I realized it had much wider appeal: as a definitive, exhaustive,
and collaborative platform for annotating all of literature.


# Distinctions

anno.wiki is the principal deployment, owned by us, of the software I call the
Intertextual Canon Cloud.

Intertextual Canon Cloud 2 refers to the currently in-development rewrite of the
ICC software. The first iteration failed, and was badly designed, so I am
currently undertaking a complete, ground up rewrite.


# Future

This wiki will serve as the documentation resource for how the software. It is
my hope that one day this software will be deployed as multiple instances
focusing on different things: scientific journals, biblical exegesis, media
criticism, creative writing workshops, the possibilities are fairly endless.
